Player;
is a trash can.
should have a gun.
should collect *crazy* guns throughout each level.
could have finishing move called "trash talk" where they insult the object there attacking - 
	i.e if its a hoover they'd say you suck! and the hoover would say well ye- and then explode

Levels;
should be procedurally generated.

Enemies;
are trash (literally).
should come in tons (for chaos of course).
should shoot lots of bullets (producing further chaos).
should create tons of explosions (MORE CHAOS).
should have interesting attacks (for ... ehem - chaos).
bullets could bounce for difficulty increase.
bullets should fade over time.


The Game;
Should be near impossible to defeat but keep the player alive to let them suffer (MWAHAHAHHA)
