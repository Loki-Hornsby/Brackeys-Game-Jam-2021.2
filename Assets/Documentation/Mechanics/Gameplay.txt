Player;
is a trash can.
should have a gun.
should collect *crazy* guns throughout each level.

are trash (literally).
should come in tons (for chaos of course).
should shoot lots of bullets (producing further chaos).
should create tons of explosions (MORE CHAOS).

The Game;
Should be near impossible to defeat but keep the player alive to let them suffer (MWAHAHAHHA)
